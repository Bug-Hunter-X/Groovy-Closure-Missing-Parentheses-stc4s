This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Groovy: omitting parentheses when defining closures.  The provided `bug.groovy` file shows the incorrect syntax, while `bugSolution.groovy` offers the corrected version. This highlights the importance of paying attention to parentheses for correct closure definition.  The issue is often related to the flexibility of Groovy's syntax, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not handled precisely.
